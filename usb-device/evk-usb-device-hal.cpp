    // The STM32F72x has 4 Kbytes of dedicated RAM for the USB data FIFOs in HS mode.
    // FIFO size is set as 32-bit words i.e. 0x200 words is 2048 bytes or half the dedicated RAM.
    // From 32.11.3 FIFO RAM allocation/Device Mode of the reference manual:
    //     10 locations must be reserved in the receive FIFO to receive SETUP packets on control endpoint.
    //     One location is to be allocated for Global OUT NAK.
    // By location I think it means 'word'.
    // The reference manual doesn't say where these reserved locations are but it appears from
    // 'USBPhyHw::init' and 'STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.16.0/Projects/STM32F723E-Discovery/Applications/USB_Device/HID_Standalone/Src/usbd_conf.c'
    // that not all the words should be allocated here.
    // 'USBPhyHw::init' is a poor example because it thinks there is only '1.25 kbytes' of RAM available.
    // I've copied these numbers from 'usbd_conf.c'.
    // I think the rational is something like:
    //     Packets of varying sizes can be received so allocate an arbitrarily large RX FIFO i.e. half the available space.
    //     If the application will result in more TX packets then, I guess, this could be reduced.
    //     Control packets on EP0 have a max size of 64 bytes so I think 0x80 means there's room for 8 TX control packets in the FIFO.
    //     TX packets on EP1 could be 512 bytes so 0x174 words (1488 bytes) means there's room for nearly 3 packets in the FIFO.
    //     If the application will be sending  many bulk 512 byte packets I guess the TX FIFO size could be increased to make room for 3, or 4, packets.
    // 'usbd_conf.c' seems to leave 12 words unallocated when I expected 11. Either there's something I don't understand or there's another word up for grabs.
